This is the repository for the Atelies website ([www.atelies.com.br](http://www.atelies.com.br)). 
It is a Brazilian ecommerce site where people can create their own stores and customers can buy from these stores. 
It is made from the craft community to the craft community, to allow them to express and sell their art without being 
bound to any corporation or larger website. A craftsperson is able to sell direct to anyone, and can do it with or without
any payment gateway. Their customer is their customer, they don't have to display any message whatsoever regarding the Atelies
website.
This is a community project. It is open source. It is paid for by the people who own the stores and it is a NON profit site.
It always be a non profit site. The code is open source to make sure it will always be free or very much afordable (always
much more afordable than it would be if it were commercial). 
It is made using the most recent technologies, and it is hostable in most cloud providers, like Azure, AWS or Heroku. We are using Heroku
right now because they better support NodeJS than any other cloud provider.

This website is a good start if you want to build a modern Node app using a Single Page App approach. It uses Backbone for the
browser code and is has tests all over it. The code quality is good, and it will constantly evolve.

## Documentation

I will probably start some blog posts (see blog address below) and will republish them here. Nothing so far.
